    a. bash

    b. make

    c. docker

    d. docker-compose v2

    e. jdk 17

2. AccelByte Cloud demo environment.

    a. Base URL: https://demo.accelbyte.io.

    b. [Create a Game Namespace](https://docs.accelbyte.io/esg/uam/namespaces.html#tutorials) if you don't have one yet. Keep the `Namespace ID`.

    c. [Create an OAuth Client](https://docs.accelbyte.io/guides/access/iam-client.html) with confidential client type with the following permission. Keep the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
